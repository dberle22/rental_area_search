# POI Categories Reference

This is the taxonomy source of truth for NYC Area Mapper POIs.

We maintain two active POI source families:

- **Curated**: personal or editorial taste-driven places resolved through Google Places and loaded into `dim_user_poi_v2`
- **Public**: baseline open-data or official-source places loaded into `dim_public_poi`

These source families are not taxonomy levels. The taxonomy itself is:

- `category`: top-level group used for broad filtering and modeling
- `subcategory`: the main drill-down within a category
- `detail_level_3`: optional deeper descriptor when a subcategory needs more structure

Restaurant example:

- `category=restaurants`
- `subcategory=japanese`
- `detail_level_3=ramen`, `sushi`, or `izakaya`

---

## Taxonomy Rules

### Curated taxonomy

- Curated source of truth lives in `data/raw/google_maps/poi_nyc/`
- Scraped editorial inputs should follow a file-first path under
  `data/raw/scraped/` before they are staged into DuckDB
- Curated restaurant-family files should roll up to `category=restaurants`
- `subcategory` should be the one stable, primary bucket used for filtering
- Use file identity first for `subcategory`, then fall back to `Tags` or `Comment` when the file is intentionally mixed
- Keep raw `tags` and `comment` values even when taxonomy is derived from them
- If a curated file represents a broad list, `subcategory` may be blank until a reliable rule exists
- `detail_level_3` should be treated as a flexible descriptor layer, not a strict hierarchy
- A row may effectively have multiple level-3 descriptors, for example a sandwich shop tagged as both `deli` and `italian`
- For restaurant cuisine families, a good rule of thumb is:
  `subcategory` = stable cuisine or format bucket such as `japanese`, `jewish`, `chinese`, or `mexican`
  `detail_level_3` = more specific descriptors within that subcategory such as `ramen`, `sushi`, `izakaya`, `deli`, or `appetizing`
- For scraped editorial sources:
  `category` and `subcategory` should come from article identity first
  split multi-address mentions into distinct source rows before Places resolution
  use description keywords only as fallback hints, mainly for `detail_level_3`

### Curated scraping workflow

- Package path: `src/nyc_property_finder/curated_poi/web_scraping/`
- Article inventory config: `config/curated_scrape_articles.yaml`
- Organize scraper modules by publication under `publications/`
- Current first implemented publication: `Eater`
- Use a file-first workflow:
  `raw capture -> normalized CSV -> QA review -> stg_user_poi_web_scrape -> canonical merge`
- Preferred capture modes:
  `parser` for structured publication scrapers
  `semi_manual` for saved text or HTML plus a lightweight extractor
  `manual_seed` for low-volume one-off articles

Normalized scrape files should be written to a path shaped like:

`data/raw/scraped/normalized/<category>_<publication>_<slug>_<date>.csv`

Recommended raw capture path:

`data/raw/scraped/raw/<publication>/<slug>_<date>.{html,txt,json}`

Minimum normalized scrape fields:

- `publisher`
- `article_title`
- `article_url`
- `source_list_name`
- `item_rank`
- `item_name`
- `item_url`
- `raw_address`
- `raw_description`
- `raw_neighborhood`
- `raw_borough`
- `category`
- `subcategory`
- `detail_level_3`
- `scraped_at`

Pre-resolution row grain:

- one scraped source mention per physical location candidate
- if one venue is listed with multiple addresses, emit one row per address

Taxonomy precedence for scraped inputs:

1. Article or list identity
2. Publication-specific parser hints
3. Description keyword extraction
4. Google Places metadata after resolution for enrichment only

### Public taxonomy

- Public POIs should use stable source-driven categories
- `subcategory` should capture source-native distinctions that are helpful in the UI or QA
- `detail_level_3` is optional and usually not needed unless a source exposes a meaningful third layer

## Curated Taxonomy (`dim_user_poi_v2`)

Build process: curate a Google Maps saved list or other curated source, export
or normalize to CSV, save under `data/raw/google_maps/poi_nyc/`, then run
`ingest_google_places_poi`.

### Curated legacy root-level files

These files in `data/raw/google_maps/` predate the `poi_nyc/` directory.
Superseded files should not be re-ingested once their `poi_nyc/` replacement is
loaded.

## Planned Curated Scraped Inputs

These are future curated sources that should map into the same taxonomy as
`dim_user_poi_v2`.

| Category | Subcategory | Target Article / Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| restaurants | mixed_restaurants | Eater NYC "38 Essential Restaurants" | planned |
| restaurants | mixed_restaurants | NYT "100 Best Restaurants in NYC" | planned |

### Scraping Inputs By Publication

Config note:

- `config/curated_scrape_articles.yaml` is the implementation-facing source of
  truth for scraped article inventory, article status, and parser-investment tracking
- the table below should stay aligned with that config but remains the more
  readable planning view

## How to Add a New Curated Entry

1. Create or collect the curated list.
2. Decide its `category`, `subcategory`, and optional `detail_level_3`.
   Example: `restaurants -> japanese -> ramen`.
3. If the source is scraped, capture raw HTML or text under `data/raw/scraped/raw/`.
4. Normalize scraped output or Takeout output to a CSV in the appropriate raw directory.
5. Add an entry to the curated taxonomy table above with status `raw` or `planned`.
6. If taxonomy is ambiguous, define the rule for deriving category first, then subcategory, then any optional `detail_level_3` from article identity, `Tags`, `Comment`, or description keywords.
7. Update `config/poi_categories.yaml` and any pipeline normalization rules as needed.
8. Run the appropriate curated pipeline.
9. Update status to `loaded` with row counts after QA.

## How to Add a New Public Entry

1. Identify the source dataset.
2. Decide its `category`, `subcategory`, and optional `detail_level_3`.
3. Add or update the source loader under `src/nyc_property_finder/public_poi/sources/`.
4. Wire the category into the public POI pipeline.
5. Run `ingest_public_poi` and verify row counts.
6. Add or update the entry in the public taxonomy table above.

-- Build: property_explorer_gold.fct_nta_features
--
-- Source contract:
--   property_explorer_gold.fct_tract_features must already exist.
--   property_explorer_gold.dim_tract_to_nta must already exist.
--
-- Business logic:
--   1. Join tract features to the authoritative tract-to-NTA mapping.
--   2. Use an inner join so only mapped tracts contribute to NTA summaries.
--   3. Aggregate numeric tract metrics with median(), matching the current
--      Python pipeline implementation.
--   4. Crime is deferred for the MVP, but the nullable column is retained.
